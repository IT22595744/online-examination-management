                    <p>Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills,
                        values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training,
                        storytelling, discussion, and targeted research. Education frequently takes place under the
                        guidance of educators, but learners may also educate themselves. Education can take place in
                        formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on how one thinks,
                        feels, or acts may be considered educational. The teaching methodology is frequently determined
                        by the environment in which it takes place and the needs of the learner.</p>
